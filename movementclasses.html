    <h2>Yoga</h2>
    <p>
    Yoga is a low impact workout that brings movement to the body and stillness to one's mind. Yoga allows all individuals to improve on stretching and strengthening. Allowing the body to move in both active and passive mobility. Many muscles are often overseen in daily tasks and can become a reason for body pain. Yoga's full body movement can improve muscle pain by releasing tissue tension and providing muscle strength. 
    Spinal mobility is promoted through spinal elongation, and spinal compression from posture hold and flows which aid in regulating your stress response system. Full body movement with the inclusion of breath focus, eases anxiety and nervousness without having to use prescription drugs through the reduction  of heart rate, respiration rate, and blood pressure .

    <h3>Hatha</h3>
    <h4>Most Suitable for Beginners</h4>
    <p> 
    Hatha Yoga is a form of yoga practiced that uses a combination of asana and Pranayama(conscious breathing) to develop strength, flexibility and relaxation.
    Hatha Yoga builds strength and brings focus to the body, by focusing on longer static holds, emphasis is placed on the pose itself as removing the flow removes the focus on the linking movements. 
    This class is not a set sequence, you can expect to learn something new, however the focus will be on foundational postures, modifications will be provided for every experience level, allowing you to expand your practice. Students can use this class to build on precision and alignment and try new postures.  
    </p>
    <h3>Yin</h3>
    <h4>Most Suitable for Beginners</h4>
    <p>
    Yin yoga is often described as the other half of a yoga practice. In relation to Yoga, a Yang practice is a faster practice, affecting muscles, making them longer and stronger. 
    In Yin yoga the practice is a slower deeper practice that affects the body's connective tissues. This practice encourages the body to slow down and become mindfully in the poses. The breath is highly focused on the sensations promoted by the pose. The posture steadiness in stillness allows one to develop passive body's meridians and joints.
    </p>
    <h3>Yin/Yang Fusion</h3>
    <h4>Most Suitable for Beginners</h4>
    <p>
    Ying practice and Yang practice are two different styles of yoga. They both hold different practice intentions however both are needed for a balanced and healthy body. 
    Yang practice is movement that builds to a peak posture before calming down which requires appropriate effort to maintain core strength.Yin Yoga is slow practice, with a sense of core softness and surrender. The fusion of these two practices creates balance of building mobility as well as strength in the deep connective tissues and joints(yin), while lengthening and strengthening the muscles in the body(yang).Having the combination of Yin yoga and Yang yoga allows the development of inner alignment, creating the foundation for postural alignment. 
    </p>

    <h3>Power Flow</h3>
    <p>

    <h2>Pilates</h2>
        <p>
            Pilates is a focused method of exercise, It is a full body workout either practiced on a mat or on the pilates equipment.  Pilates improves physical strength, flexibility, and posture. The spine needs you to move in all directions and to have a strong support starting from your abdomen, back, hips and pelvic floor. 
            Pilates focuses on strengthening these muscles, and building the foundation of your proper spinal support. Pilates equipment is called a reformer; it facilitates deep muscle rehabilitation and conditioning through the use of resistance maximizing the whole body strength and agility.
        </p>
        <h3>Reformer Pilates</h3>
        <p>
            Reformer pilates is different to mat pilates as you are not limited to the use of your body weight to create muscle resistance. The reformer builds the smaller core muscles, also stretching out the longer muscles in the body.
            The spring in the reformer creates more resistance and allows you to engage your upper body in more ways than mat exercises increasing the difficulty of the workout, adding posture improvements. 
        </p>
        <h3>Mat Pilates</h3>
        <p>
            Mat pilates class has a combination of small prop equipment such as arm weights,workout balls and the use of one's own body weight to challenge your core and stamina. 
            Matwork allows students to receive a full-body workout, while improving your overall body awareness and muscle tone.
